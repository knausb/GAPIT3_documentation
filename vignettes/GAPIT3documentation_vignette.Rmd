## Installation

A first question for a new user is whetehr GAPIT3 is already installed?
You can query your system for the presence of GAPIT3 with the following command.


```
find.package("GAPIT3")
```


If GAPIT3 is installed, this command should return the location of the package.
If it returns an error then you probably need to install it as follows.


```
devtools::install_github("jiabowang/GAPIT3",force=TRUE)
```

You can install this documentation package as well.

```
devtools:install_github("knausb/GAPIT3documentation", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```


Decided you did not need this package after all?
You can remove it as follows.


```
remove.packages(pkgs = "GAPIT3")
remove.packages(pkgs = "GAPIT3documentation")
```
